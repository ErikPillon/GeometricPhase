\section{Second Mathematical Interlude}


We can imagine the tangent vector as the tangent of a smooth curve passing for the point. We can therefore condifer a curve superimposed to the fiber. The tangent space generated will be called \emph{vertical space}
\begin{equation}
V_{\psi}\B = \left\{ia\psi\mid a\in\R \right\} \subset T_{\psi}\B
\end{equation} 
%and so we can immefiately see that the ingredients will be
