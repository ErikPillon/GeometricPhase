\chapter{Overview}

The work is given by a total amount of 6 sections; this first introductory section is an overview of the subject. The second section is a discussion about the Berry original work: first as a sempilified form and then as it was originally presented by prof. Berry. The third section will be the generalization given by Aharonov and A. and a year later by Samuel and A. In that third section we eill introduce also a brief mathematical interlude and some geometrical consideration about curvature. The fourth section is devoted essentially to the so called Kinematic Approach and we will bring the concept of Bargman invariance and its connection to curvature and the interesting appliation to the entire formalisma. Fifth section will be a second mathematical interlude on simplectic and riemannian manifolds. Sixth section will be about the null phase idea.
