\chapter{Overview}

The work is given by a total amount of 6 sections; this first introductory section is an overview of the subject. The second section is a discussion about the Berry original work: first as a sempilified form and then as it was originally presented by prof. Berry in his seminal paper \cite{berry1985classical}. 

The third section will cover the work of Aharonov and Anandan\cite{aharonov1987phase} on the relaxation of the adiabatic hypothesis and, a year later, by Samuel and Bhandari \cite{samuel1988general} on the relaxation of the cyclicity condition. In this third section we will also introduce a brief mathematical interlude and some geometrical consideration about curvature and connection. 

The fourth section is devoted essentially to the so called Kinematic Approach: we will bring the concept of Bargman invariance and its connection to curvature and the interesting application to the entire formalism. 

Fifth section will be a second mathematical interlude on simplectic and riemannian manifolds. 

Sixth section will be about the null phase idea.
